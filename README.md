This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To Run the App
Put the following URL into your browser. The app has been tested in Chrome but should work with other browsers:
                https://katiep28.github.io/coop-chuck-norris/


### Testing Business Logic
I created a separate test folder, and created a javascript function to test the business logic. I automated the testing using JEST,

The function is in BusinessLogicTest.js and the automated tests are in businessLogic.test.js

To run these you will need to clone the repository to execute the tests.

I chose deliberately not to sentence case the names as people may have stylistic ways or writing their names using a mix of upper and lower case. This was a concious decision not to add validation to do that.
